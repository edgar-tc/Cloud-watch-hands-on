# Cloud-watch-hands-on
Excited to share my latest cloud DevOps project! I used AWS CloudFormation to create an EC2 Linux instance and set up CPU utilization monitoring with CloudWatch. To simulate high usage, I wrote a Python script that spiked CPU to over 80%. Configured an alarm at 50% to get email alerts via SNS.
